MooDating 🐄 is a frontend-only web application built with Next.js for the Google Solution Challenge. It helps dairy farmers find ideal breeding partners for their cows by displaying potential matches with relevant details. The app also features cow breed prediction, calf trait analysis, and other advanced insights to assist in better breeding decisions. The main MVP is hosted in another repository, and the link will be added soon.
